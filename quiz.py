# ðŸŽ¯ Challenge-Style Exercises
# Matrix Transformation:
# Given an array of 3D points, rotate them 90Â° around the Z-axis and then translate them by (1, 2, 3). Show the result.
# Flatten and Reshape:
# Flatten a (3, 4, 5) array to 2D, then reshape it back to the original shape.
# Batch Matrix Multiply:
# Given arrays A of shape (10, 3, 3) and B of shape (10, 3, 1), compute A[i] @ B[i] for all i.
# Normalization:
# Normalize a (100, 3) array so each point lies on the unit sphere.
# Project Points:
# Given R, T, K, and 3D points, compute the 2D pixel coordinates (as in the camera model).
